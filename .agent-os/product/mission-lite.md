# Product Mission (Lite)

CastleRooms is a read-only booking visualization application that helps Impro Neuf team members understand room availability and existing bookings by providing a clear calendar view of all bookings from the YesPlan system without requiring write access.

CastleRooms serves Impro Neuf team members who need quick visibility into room booking status without navigating YesPlan's full interface. Unlike YesPlan's comprehensive system, CastleRooms provides a calendar-centric, read-only focused experience that eliminates complexity and makes availability immediately obvious through intuitive visual indicators.
