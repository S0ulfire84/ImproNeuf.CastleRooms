# Spec Summary (Lite)

Fix the calendar view to properly display events that are being fetched from the YesPlan API. Events are currently being fetched successfully but not appearing in the calendar view. This spec will identify and fix the root cause preventing events from displaying, ensuring all fetched events are properly normalized, filtered, and rendered on the calendar.
