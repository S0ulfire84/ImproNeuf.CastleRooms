# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement color-coded event display on the calendar where each event is assigned a unique color based on its name using a hash function. Events with the same name will consistently receive the same color, and colors will be generated using HSV color space to ensure readability by only varying the hue while maintaining consistent saturation and value.
